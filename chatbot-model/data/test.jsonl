{"question": "What powers do Inspectors have when a dangerous condition exists in a mine?", "answer": "Inspectors under the Mines Act, 1952 have extensive powers when they identify any dangerous or defective condition not explicitly covered by law. They may issue a written notice specifying the hazardous condition and the corrective measures required, along with a deadline. If the mine management fails to comply, the Inspector or Chief Inspector may prohibit employment in the affected area, allowing only essential persons needed to correct the danger. In cases of urgent and immediate danger, the Inspector may instantly prohibit employment until the danger is removed. Affected workers are entitled to full wages or alternative employment.

They are also exclusively responsible for compliance with certain rules (under Section 58). If instructions they issue result in violations, they are personally liable. In cases where contraventions occur, supervisory officials, the manager, and the owner/agent may all be deemed guilty unless they can prove they exercised due diligence. Simply appointing a manager does not exempt the owner or agent from liability.", "context": "THE MINES ACT, 1952, Section 18", "relevant_chunks": [40]}
{"question": "How must drinking water be provided in mines?", "answer": "Mines must provide a sufficient supply of clean and wholesome drinking water at convenient and accessible locations.

{"question": "What records must be maintained in the Register of Persons Employed in a mine?", "answer": "Section 48 requires every mine to maintain a detailed register of all persons employed. This register must record the employee’s full identity details, age, sex, nature of employment (above or below ground), and the date of commencement of work. Entries must be authenticated by signature or thumb impression. Additional special registers are required to separately track workers below ground, in opencast workings, and in other above-ground operations.

No person may be employed unless their details are recorded, and employment must strictly follow the work periods indicated in the register. These records ensure legal compliance, worker safety, and accurate monitoring.", "context": "Section 48 – Register of persons employed.", "relevant_chunks": [70]}
